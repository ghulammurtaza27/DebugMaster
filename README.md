# DebugMaster

DebugMaster is an intelligent debugging-as-a-service application that leverages AI to automatically analyze, diagnose, and fix bugs in your codebase. It integrates with Sentry for error detection and GitHub for automated pull request creation.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **AI-Powered Bug Analysis**: Automatically analyzes errors and generates intelligent fixes
- **Deep Codebase Understanding**: Builds a comprehensive knowledge graph of your codebase
- **Automated Fix Generation**: Creates pull requests with fixes and detailed explanations
- **Cross-File Analysis**: Understands complex relationships between files and components
- **Test-Aware Fixes**: Ensures fixes don't break existing functionality

### Advanced Context Building
- **Knowledge Graph**: Maps dependencies and relationships between files
- **Code Analysis**: Analyzes import statements and function calls
- **Git History**: Leverages Git history for pattern recognition
- **Sequential Thinking**: Breaks down complex bugs into manageable parts
- **Test Coverage**: Includes test files in analysis context

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows for scheduled analysis
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time issue processing from Sentry
- **Rate Limiting**: Smart API quota management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track success rates and processing times
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize automated bug fixes

### Monitoring & Analytics
- **Issue Tracking**: Monitor issues processed and fixes attempted
- **Success Metrics**: Track fix success rates and processing times
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error and edge case logging
- **Performance Reports**: Regular summary reports of service performance

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.x
- PostgreSQL 16.x
- GitHub account with appropriate permissions
- Sentry account with API access
